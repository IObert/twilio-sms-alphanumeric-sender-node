# Send SMS Without a Phone Number Using an Alphanumeric Sender ID

Sending SMS is a convenient way to notify your users about time-sensitive matters. These messages are often closely related to an action the user just triggered. For example, receiving a One-Time-Password (OTP) when transferring money from a banking app is common. In these situations, the user probably doesnâ€™t mind which number sent the message. In other cases, especially when you notify users "out of the blue", you might prefer to display your company name as a sender. Alphanumeric Sender IDs allow you to do exactly that.

This repository accompanies [this blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/send-sms-without-phone-number-node-js).


## Requirements
* You will need an [upgraded Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
* The code at the end of this post uses JavaScript, so make sure your [Node.js environment](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is set up.


## Running the Code

1. Clone the project, change into the directory and install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/IObert/twilio-sms-alphanumeric-sender-node
    cd twilio-sms-alphanumeric-sender-node
    ```

2. Create a new `.env` file. Here you're going to store the credentials you need to make calls to the Twilio API; your Account SID and Auth Token. You can find them in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console). Copy the lines below into .env and then paste the values of the two Twilio credentials in place of the two placeholders.
    ```sh
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID 
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
    ```

3. Open the `send-alpha.js` file and substituted the parameters marked with `TODO` in the `client.messages.create()` function call.

4. Run the script on the command line to receive a message from your alphanumeric sender ID.

    ```bash
    node send-alpha.js
    ```

## You've Done It!
